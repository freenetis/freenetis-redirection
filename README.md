FreenetIS Redirection
=====================

FreenetIS redirection is tool which depends on FreenetIS and it is used for restriction of traffic. Restrictions are activated in the FreenetIS and they may be applicated on clouds, subnets, members or a single IP address. Devices that are not registered in the FreenetIS are automatically restricted. System administrators may edit messages that are displayed to restricted  users instead of web pages that they have requested.
